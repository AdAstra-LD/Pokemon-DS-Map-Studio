# Pokemon DS Map Studio
Pokemon DS Map Studio is a tool for creating gen 4 and gen 5 Pok√©mon games' maps, designed to be used alongside SDSME.

It doesn't require 3D modeling, instead it provides a tilemap-like interface that is automatically converted in a 3D model.
Note that this tool **DOES NOT** import maps from the original games, neither it can modify them.

### Supported games:
- Pokemon Diamond/Pearl
- Pokemon Platinum
- Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver
### Not completely working
- Pokemon Black/White
- Pokemon Black 2/ White 2

## Running
For running Pokemon DS Map Studio, Java 8 must be installed in the computer.
Pokemon DS Map Studio can be executed by double clicking the "PokemonDsMapStudio.jar" file. 
If this does not work, use the "PokemonDsMapStudio.bat".
If these methods do not work, it may be because your graphics card is not compatible with OpenGL 2.

For exporting `.nsbmd` files, "g3dcvtr.exe" and "xerces-c_2_5_0.dll" must be placed int the "converter" folder.
