# Pokemon DS Map Studio
Pokemon DS Map Studio is a tool for creating gen 4 and gen 5 Pok√©mon games' maps, designed to be used alongside SDSME.

It doesn't require 3D modeling, instead it provides a tilemap-like interface that is automatically converted in a 3D model.
Note that this tool **DOES NOT** import maps from the original games, neither it can modify them.
